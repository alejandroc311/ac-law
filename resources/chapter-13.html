          <p>
            Chapter 13 bankruptcy is designed for people who have income and
            want to keep property while getting relief from overwhelming debt.
            Unlike Chapter 7, which focuses on discharge and liquidation,
            Chapter 13 is a court supervised repayment process that allows
            debtors to reorganize their finances over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chapter 13 is often used by homeowners, people behind on car
            payments, and individuals who do not qualify for Chapter 7 or who
            would lose important assets in a liquidation case.
          </p>

          <h2
            class="text-center text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold"

          >
            How Chapter 13 Works
          </h2>

          <p>
            In a Chapter 13 case, the debtor proposes a repayment plan that
            lasts either three or five years. The length of the plan depends
            primarily on whether the debtor’s household income is above or below
            the applicable median income.
          </p>

          <p>
            Debtors below the median may qualify for a three year plan. Debtors
            above the median are generally required to propose a five year plan.
            During this time, the debtor makes a single monthly payment to the
            Chapter 13 trustee, who then distributes funds to creditors
            according to the terms of the confirmed plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the end of the plan, any remaining dischargeable debt is wiped
            out and the debtor receives a discharge.
          </p>

          <h2
            class="text-center text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold"
            style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; color: #3b372e"
          >
            Curing Arrears and Keeping Property
          </h2>

          <p>
            One of the most powerful features of Chapter 13 is the ability to
            cure arrears over time. This is especially important for people who
            are behind on mortgage or vehicle payments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Past due mortgage payments can be rolled into the Chapter 13 plan
            and paid back gradually over the life of the plan, while the debtor
            resumes making regular ongoing mortgage payments going forward. This
            allows many homeowners to stop foreclosure and keep their home, even
            if they were months or years behind at the time of filing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The same concept applies to vehicle loans. Missed payments can be
            cured through the plan while the debtor keeps the car, as long as
            the plan complies with the Bankruptcy Code.
          </p>

          <h2
            class="text-center text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold"

            What Creditors Actually Receive
          </h2>

          <p>
            Not all debts are treated equally in a Chapter 13 plan. Certain
            obligations must be paid in full, such as domestic support
            obligations and some tax debts. Secured creditors are paid according
            to the value of their collateral and the terms allowed under the
            Code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unsecured creditors like credit card companies and medical providers
            are often paid very little, and in many cases nothing at all. The
            reason is simple. If those creditors would receive nothing in a
            Chapter 7 case, they are not entitled to more in Chapter 13. Many
            plans provide only a minimal dividend to unsecured creditors, and
            some provide none.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the required plan payments are completed, any remaining
            eligible unsecured debt is discharged.
          </p>

            Cramdown and Lien Stripping Explained
          </h2>
          <p>
            Chapter 13 provides restructuring tools that do not exist in Chapter
            7, including cramdown and lien stripping. These concepts are
            technical, but their practical effect can be significant.
          </p>

          <p>
            A cramdown allows a debtor to treat a secured claim as secured only
            up to the value of the collateral, rather than the full loan
            balance. The most common example involves a vehicle loan. If a
            debtor owes more on a car than the car is worth, and the vehicle was
            purchased more than the required period before filing, the debtor
            may be able to pay only the car’s current value through the Chapter
            13 plan. The remaining balance is treated as unsecured debt and is
            often paid barely or at all. Once the plan is completed, the debtor
            owns the vehicle free of the inflated loan balance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lien stripping applies to certain junior liens on real property. If
            a home is worth no more than the balance of the first mortgage, a
            second mortgage or junior lien may be considered entirely unsecured.
            In that situation, the junior lien can be treated like unsecured
            debt in the Chapter 13 plan. It may receive little or no payment,
            and upon successful completion of the plan and entry of discharge,
            the lien can be removed from the property.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both cramdown and lien stripping depend on precise valuation,
            timing, and compliance with statutory requirements. When used
            correctly, they can dramatically change the financial outcome of a
            case.

            Income, Expenses, and Reasonableness
          </h2>

          <p>
            Chapter 13 requires full financial transparency. Debtors must
            disclose all income and all expenses, and those expenses are
            evaluated in one of two ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some expenses are governed by IRS National and Local Standards. When
            an expense falls within those standards, it is presumed reasonable
            by law. If the debtor’s claimed expense is at or below the
            applicable IRS standard, the trustee and the court accept it without
            further scrutiny.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other expenses are not governed by IRS standards at all. These
            expenses do not come with preset caps or automatic approval.
            Instead, they are reviewed for reasonableness based on the debtor’s
            actual circumstances. If the trustee believes an expense is
            excessive, unnecessary, or inflated, the trustee may object and
            require the debtor to justify it or reduce it.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, housing and transportation expenses are subject to IRS
            standards and are presumed reasonable when claimed within those
            limits. Expenses such as private school tuition, unusually high
            medical costs, or discretionary spending are not governed by IRS
            standards and may be closely reviewed. Chapter 13 does not allow a
            debtor to overstate expenses in order to reduce plan payments.
          </p>

          <p>
            A confirmable plan must reflect an honest and accurate picture of
            the debtor’s financial reality.

            Objections and Plan Confirmation
          </h2>

          <p>
            After a plan is filed, the Chapter 13 trustee and creditors have the
            opportunity to object. Common objections involve disposable income,
            valuation of collateral, treatment of secured claims, or feasibility
            of the plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            If objections are resolved and the court finds that the plan meets
            all statutory requirements, the plan is confirmed. Confirmation
            binds the debtor and creditors to the plan terms as long as payments
            are made.
          </p>

            Mortgage Modification and Mediation
          </h2>

          <p>
            In some cases, Chapter 13 debtors may pursue mortgage modification
            or mediation while under court protection. This can potentially
            result in lower payments or improved loan terms, but success depends
            entirely on the lender, the loan type, and the debtor’s financial
            circumstances.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mortgage modification is not guaranteed and is highly case specific.
            It can be a valuable tool in the right situation, but it is not a
            universal solution.
          </p>

          <h2
            class="text-center text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold"

            Feasibility of the Chapter 13 Plan
          </h2>

          <p>
            In addition to meeting the legal requirements of the Bankruptcy
            Code, a Chapter 13 plan must be feasible. Feasibility means the plan
            must be realistically payable based on the debtor’s actual income
            and expenses.
          </p>

          <p>
            The court and the Chapter 13 trustee are not required to confirm a
            plan simply because it looks correct on paper. If the proposed
            payment leaves no margin for ordinary living expenses, or depends on
            income that is uncertain or speculative, the plan may be denied
            confirmation. The question is whether the debtor can reasonably be
            expected to make the proposed payments over the life of the plan.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, a plan that assumes consistent overtime, future
            bonuses, or income from a source that is not reliable may be
            challenged as infeasible. Similarly, a plan that leaves the debtor
            with no ability to handle routine expenses or minor emergencies may
            not be approved.
          </p>

          <p>
            Feasibility is intended to protect both the debtor and the system
            itself. A plan that cannot be completed only delays the inevitable
            and wastes time and resources. A confirmable plan must be ambitious
            enough to meet statutory requirements, but grounded enough to
            succeed in the real world.
          </p>

            Completion and Discharge
          </h2>

          <p>
            Once all required plan payments are made, the debtor receives a
            Chapter 13 discharge. At that point, remaining dischargeable debts
            are eliminated, liens treated under the plan are resolved according
            to their terms, and the debtor emerges current on secured
            obligations that were cured through the case.
          </p>

          <p>
            For many people, Chapter 13 provides a structured path out of
            financial distress while preserving the assets that matter most.
